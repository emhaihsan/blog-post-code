# Chatbot with LangChain: GPT-4o Mini and Ollama Phi 3

This project demonstrates how to build chatbot applications using LangChain, integrating both paid and open-source large language models (LLMs). The examples include using GPT-4o Mini from OpenAI and Phi 3 from Ollama.

## Introduction

In the digital age, chatbots have become essential tools for enhancing interactions between humans and computers. This project leverages LangChain, an ecosystem that simplifies the integration of LLMs, to build efficient and responsive chatbot applications.

## Why LangChain

LangChain offers several advantages for developers:
- **Ease of Integration**: Simplifies the integration of various LLMs into applications.
- **Flexibility**: Supports both paid and open-source models, allowing developers to choose the most suitable model for their needs.
- **Monitoring and Tracing**: Provides real-time monitoring and tracing features, aiding in debugging and optimizing applications.
